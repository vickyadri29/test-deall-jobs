# Deall Jobs Test

### How we start it :
- because the API can't access and fetch, so use Google Chrome extension called Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin to allow the ignore the block CORS origin <br>
`npm install` <br>
`npm run start`<br>


### Feedback
For the feedback, to give auth to the API so that security is better maintained. Please also give access to CORS Origin to make it easier for the frontend team to use the API.
